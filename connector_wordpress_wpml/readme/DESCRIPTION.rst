* This module works with plugin WordPress Multi Language.
* https://wpml.org/

On WPML settings uncheck the options
  * When uploading media to the Media library, make it available in all languages.
  * Duplicate media attachments for translations.

If we don't do this, the media files will be created once for each language, which it can be a problem for the capacity of the server.
