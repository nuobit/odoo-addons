The "connector_extension" module is an add-on for the Odoo ERP system that enhances the functionality of the base "connector" module. This extension provides additional features, tools, and integrations, making it easier for developers to create, manage, and maintain connections between Odoo and various third-party systems, APIs, or services.

The module aims to simplify the connector development process by providing a robust and flexible framework. The "connector_extension" module allows developers to focus on implementing specific business logic and requirements, while the extension handles common tasks.


* Extended connector framework: The module extends the base connector framework by providing new classes, methods, and utilities for easier integration with third-party systems.
* Reusable components: Pre-built components for handling common tasks such error handling, and data synchronization.
* Enhanced data mapping: Advanced data mapping capabilities to transform and adapt data between Odoo and external systems seamlessly.
* Scalability and performance improvements: Optimized for handling large datasets and concurrent connections, ensuring smooth and efficient data synchronization.
* Linking with existing records: Enables linking with existing records, using alternate keys, which allows for easier data management and reduced redundancy.
